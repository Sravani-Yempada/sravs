        <dt>HEIDI </dt>
        <dd> Heidi, Girl of the Alps is an anime television series and is
            based on the novel Heidi's Years of Wandering and Learning
            by Johanna Spyri. Heidi is the 6th and final entry in Calpis 
            Comic Theater, a precursor of the World Masterpiece Theater series,
            based on classic tales from the Western world. The animation studio 
            responsible for Heidi, Zuiyo Enterprise, would split in 1975 into 
            Nippon Animation Company, Ltd. (which employed the anime's production
            staff and continued with the World Masterpiece Theater franchise)
            and Zuiyo Company, Ltd., which retained the rights (and debt) to the
            Heidi TV series. The feature-length film edit of the TV series, 
            released in March 1979, was engineered completely by Zuiyo, with no 
            additional involvement from Nippon Animation, Takahata or Miyazaki. 
            Zuiyo also re-edited the series in two OVA released in 1996.</dd>
