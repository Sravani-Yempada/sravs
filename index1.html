        My father is my role model because of his commitment to his career. He puts in a lot of effort to provide for our family. 
        He inspires me to do things I may be afraid of, in an attempt to get over my fear and to emerge victorious. 
        He teaches me life lessons such as how to treat others with respect.
        My father is my dearest buddy, and I am so grateful for him; he is God’s greatest gift to me.
        He instructs me to behave nicely, talk politely with elders and friends, help those in need, and never say anything negative about anyone because he wants me to 
        grow wise in the future. My father loves and cares for us like a farmer loves and cares for his crops. My father has made numerous sacrifices to suit the demands
        of our entire family. He is a busy man, but he manages to squeeze in time for his friends and family.A father’s relationship with his daughter is of a confidante
        and her hero, while with his son, he is a close buddy and a best friend. He acts like a child, gives advice like a friend, and guards like a bodyguard.
        Many things have been taught to me by my father and I strive to be like him. He tells me not to cry when I make errors because mistakes are how we learn in life. 
        I like his ability to look at life in a positive light. He is my hero, and I strive to instill his principles in my friends and the rest of the world. My father 
        has been encouraging and understanding, and I know that his attempts to help me become a better person will never be in vain.
        My father’s importance in my life cannot be overstated. My family’s equilibrium and calm are dependent on his presence. A father often obtains the title of the 
        stricter parent, but fathers are always those who love you immensely and are always on the lookout to protect you from anything that could hurt you.

        One morning when i woke up I didn't find my dad in home. So I asked my sibling where the dad and mom was, he said that they went to our grani's home as she was not 
        feeling well.Still it's evening our parents didn't return to home and didn't even do call to us.So I had cried much for that then my brother had said that my 
        father had been admitted into the hospital due to 'Jaundice'.No one had taken me to the hospital . When I ask about my dad everyone had said that he is feeling 
        good and he'll be back to home soon.Unfortunately, oneday my uncle had taken me to the hospital without I ask, when my dad had been in ICU. All my relatives had 
        there at the hospital and everyone had been in tensed. the I felt very hurry and Anxiety.Then my mom had taken me to the ICU but there a nurse didn't allowed me 
        into ICU as I was very young and  if I cry out the other patients will be disturbed.After requesting for sometime , she allowed. Then I saw the worst scene in my
        life that I had never seen till now. My dad on the ICU bed, pipes are in his mouth, wires are connected to the monitor and ventilator,pulse oximetry, bottles, and 
        my dad fighting with death and struggling with pain by closing eyes.I had just shocked by seeing my dad in that situation. 
        At that evening that is May 28,2015 around 5:59pm the doctor had said that my dad is no more.

        I would've never thought that I would lose the one person that meant and still means the most to me. The pain of the the lost still burdens me to this day.
        But I have learned how to keep pushing forward with my day to day life with a big smile on my face because I now know that everything will be alright.
        The sight that I saw inside the ICU will haunt me forever. A eleven year old girl should never have to witness such a thing, but it’s sad to say that some have 
        witnessed worse.When we weren’t, we were only dealing with the loss of our father. I dealt with it by not talking for a while. My brother dealt with it by acting
         out which didn’t help my mother at all.People decided to start blaming my mother for my father’s death, they even went as far as saying that she killed him 
         herself but, we knew that it wasn’t possible.
